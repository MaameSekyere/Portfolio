            A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to
            employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An
            effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the
            thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with
            deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are
            typically very successful in their career search after the boot
            camp. This last point canâ€™t be stressed enough: having several
            deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial
            interview at many companies.
